# -Polkadot-private-key-Generator

This code uses the schnorrkel library to generate a random seed and derive a key pair from it. The private and public keys are then extracted from the key pair and encoded as hexadecimal strings. The public key is also encoded as a Polkadot address using the encodeAddress function from the @polkadot/keyring library.
